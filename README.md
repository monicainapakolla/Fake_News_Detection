# Fake_News_Detection

#### Analyzed and pre-processed the text data <br />
#### Following Natural Language Processing models are implemented:  <br />
#### 1.MultiNomial Naive Bayes Algorithm<br />
#### 2.Passive Aggressive Classifier Algorithm<br />
#### 3.MultiNomial Classifier with HyperParameter<br />
### Based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall and f1-Score, the Passive Aggressive Classifier Algorithm perfomed better with 95.2% Accuracy of predicting if a given news article is fake or real
